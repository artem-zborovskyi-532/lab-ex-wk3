# Exercise 3:
    # There is an elegant algorithm for converting a decimal number to a binary number.
    # You need to carry out long division by 2 to use this algorithm. If we want to convert
    # 83 to binary then we can repeatedly perform long division by 2 on the quotient
    # of each result until the quotient is zero. Then, the string of the remainders that
    # were accumulated while dividing make up the binary number. For example,
    # 83/2 = 41 remainder 1
    # 41/2 = 20 remainder 1
    # 20/2 = 10 remainder 0
    # 10/2 = 5 remainder 0
    # 5/2 = 2 remainder 1
    # 2/2 = 1 remainder 0
    # 1/2 = 0 remainder 1
    # The remainders from last to first are 1010011 which is 8310. This set of steps is
    # called an algorithm. An algorithm is like a recipe for doing a computation. We can
    # use this algorithm any time we want to convert a number from decimal to binary.
    # Implement a script that prompts the user to enter a positive in and print a binary
    # representation of that number.
